Bhttps://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbotuild an Asteroids Game

We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids. If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) version of the game.

The finished project
Prerequisites

    Python 3.10+ installed (see the bookbot project for help if you don't already have it)
    Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)

Learning Goals

The learning goals of this project are:

    Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
    Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
    To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!

The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.
Assignment

To get started, make sure you have the Boot.dev CLI installed and working.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

The tests just ensure that the CLI is installed and configured correctly.
bootdev run 5be3e3bd-efb5-4664-a9e9-7111be783271 -s
